# Zettelkasten for Turner, Raymond C.
(rwxray)

Your text looks great! Just a few minor suggestions for improvement:

"This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ('slips' or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple, really, and very powerful.

Everything is in docs or at https://rayct.github.io/zet.

This is a highly community-driven space for inspiration, where experienced veterans can publish their brilliance.

'The smarter you are, the less you talk.'

A very special thank you to Robert S. Muhlestein (rwxrob) for inspiring me to create this and for his supreme ability and intellect to educate."
