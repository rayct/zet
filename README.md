# Zettelkasten for Turner, Raymond C.
</br>


"This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ('slips' or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple, really, and very powerful.

Everything is in docs or at https://rayct.github.io/zet.

This is a highly community-driven space for inspiration, where experienced veterans can publish their brilliance.

make difficult tasks possible\
