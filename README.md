# Zettelkasten for Turner, Raymond C.
This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ("slips" or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple really and very powerful.

Everything is in docs or at https://rayct.github.io/zet

Special Thanks to Robert S. Muhlestein (rwxrob) for Inspiring me to create this.
