# Zettelkasten for Turner, Raymond C.



This is where I dump my knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ('slips' or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple, really, and very powerful.

<!-- Everything is in docs or at https://rayct.github.io/zet. -->

This is a highly community-driven space for inspiration, where experienced veterans can publish their brilliance.
