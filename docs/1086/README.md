## **FALSE! It's a Myth**

"It's all a myth; in fact, 'Sativa' just means 'cultivate' in Latin, and 'Indica' means 'India.' These words describe what the plant looks like and how it grows, that's it. In fact, in science, the word for this is morphology (how it grows and its physical characteristics). So, Sativa does not give you energy, and Indica does not make you sleepy, although most cannabis strains labeled as Indica may have that effect on you. I mean, they may make you sleepy, but it just depends on your body. We all have an endocannabinoid system, and genetic variation plays a role in how your body metabolizes cannabis. So, it's all dependent on you. For instance, some people love OG; OGs give them energy and help them be creative. Sweet-smelling cannabis is like goodnight stories for some, while others cannot function on sweet cannabis. It all depends on a person's endocannabinoid system. It's all down to the individual. It all boils down to preference.

So, Sativa has nothing to do with energy, and Indica has nothing to do with sleep. It's really about what it smells like, what it looks like, and how your body reacts to it. You have to be your own scientist for that."
