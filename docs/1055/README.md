#### Truth is Poetry, and most people hate Poetry.

#### No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.
#### ― Plato


## **"Remember! You only know what you have been allowed to know".**

## "Tout sera révélé."

  "It's imperative to fully understand that all actions have consequences. We're aware of your past deeds and are observing closely. The day of reckoning may approach sooner than you think. Reflect upon your choices."

  "Pamiętaj, wszystkie działania mają konsekwencje. Jesteśmy świadomi twoich wcześniejszych czynów i obserwujemy uważnie. Dzień rozrachunku może nadejść szybciej niż myślisz. Zastanów się nad swoimi wyborami."

  "Rappelez-vous, chaque action a des conséquences. Nous sommes au courant de vos actes passés et observons de près. Le jour du jugement pourrait arriver plus tôt que vous ne le pensez. Méditez sur vos choix."

  "Memento, omne agere consequentias habet. Cognoscimus tua facta praeterita et attentius observamus. Dies ultionis propior venire potest quam suspicaris. Contemplare delectus tuos."

  "Denk daran, jede Handlung hat Konsequenzen. Wir sind uns deiner vergangenen Taten bewusst und beobachten genau. Der Tag der Abrechnung könnte näher sein, als du denkst. Reflektiere über deine Entscheidungen."

  "Помни, что все действия имеют последствия. Мы осведомлены о твоих прошлых поступках и внимательно наблюдаем. День расплаты может прийти ближе, чем ты думаешь. Обдумай свои выборы."


## Cause and effect: Let's explore each of these concepts:

1. **Entropy**:
   - **Definition**: In physics and thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. It represents the amount of energy in a system that is unavailable for doing work. High entropy implies high disorder, while low entropy implies order and organization.
   - **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: This law states that in any energy exchange, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state. In other words, entropy tends to increase over time in a closed system, leading to greater disorder.
   - **Information Theory**: In information theory, entropy is used to quantify the amount of uncertainty or surprise associated with a random variable. It measures the average amount of information contained in a message or data set.

2. **Cause and Effect**:
   - **Definition**: Cause and effect refer to the relationship between events where one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect). It is a fundamental concept in philosophy, science, and everyday life.
   - **Causality**: Causality is the principle that every event has a cause, and every cause produces one or more effects. Understanding causality is essential for explaining and predicting phenomena in various fields, including science and social sciences.
   - **Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Causality**: Some causal relationships are deterministic, meaning that the cause will always produce the same effect under the same conditions. In contrast, probabilistic causality allows for the possibility of multiple outcomes even with the same cause due to probabilistic or random factors.
   - **Causal Inference**: Causal inference is the process of determining whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between two variables. This can be challenging, especially in complex systems where multiple factors may be at play.

The relationship between entropy and cause and effect is not straightforward, but there are some important connections:

- In physics, the increase in entropy over time is often associated with the arrow of time and the idea that natural processes tend to move from ordered (low entropy) states to more disordered (high entropy) states. This concept is related to the idea of causality, where causes precede effects in time.

- In information theory, entropy is used to measure the uncertainty or unpredictability of events. The concept of cause and effect is related because the cause of an event is often used to predict its effect, and the degree of uncertainty (entropy) in this prediction can be quantified.

*In summary, entropy, cause and effect are fundamental concepts that play important roles in understanding the behavior of physical systems, the flow of time, and the predictability of events, but their relationships can be complex and context-dependent. They are subjects of ongoing study and philosophical inquiry in various fields.*

* ## **Benevolence** 

    Benevolence is a noun that refers to the quality or disposition of being kind, charitable, and showing goodwill toward others. It denotes a genuine desire to promote the well-being and happiness of others, often expressed through acts of generosity, compassion, or helpfulness. A benevolent person or organization is one that is characterized by a willingness to do good and to help others without expecting anything in return. Benevolence is often associated with empathy, sympathy, and a genuine concern for the welfare of others.

    *"But! Do not mistake benevolence for weakness"* 

* ## **Pretentious** 

    Pretentious is an adjective used to describe someone or something that tries to appear more important, valuable, or sophisticated than it actually is. When something is labeled as pretentious, it often means that it comes across as affected, showy, or attempting to impress others by adopting an air of significance/superiority or complexity that is not genuine or warranted.

    For example, if someone uses overly complex language in casual conversations to sound more intellectual, or if an artwork seems to be intentionally difficult to understand without offering much substance, they might be considered pretentious.

"I'm aware that labeling something as pretentious can sometimes be subjective and influenced by individual perceptions and biases. What one person considers pretentious, another might find genuinely engaging, meaningful, or, in my experience, quite frankly full of **SHIT!"**

* ## **Duplicity**
    "Duplicity" refers to the act of intentionally deceiving or misleading others by presenting false information, pretending to be someone you're not, or engaging in fraudulent activities. It involves creating a facade or a false appearance to gain an advantage, manipulate others, or achieve personal goals. Duplicity can occur in various contexts, including personal relationships, business dealings, politics, and more.

**The term 'duplicity' is often used to describe dishonest or deceitful behavior in which individuals or entities engage in actions that contradict their stated intentions or values. It's closely related to terms like deception, fraud, and deceit. This is why I chose this one above all to be top of the list, as it closely demonstrates the exact representation of current experiences.**

*In literature and storytelling, characters who exhibit duplicity often add complexity to the narrative, as their true motivations and actions are hidden from other characters and sometimes even the audience.*


* ## **Narcissist** 
    A Narcissist is someone who has an excessive and inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration and attention, and a lack of empathy for others. This term originates from Greek mythology, where Narcissus was a character who fell in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. In psychology, narcissism is considered a personality trait that exists on a spectrum, ranging from healthy self-confidence to pathological self-centeredness.

    Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a more severe and diagnosable form of narcissism. People with NPD exhibit a pattern of behavior characterized by a grandiose sense of self, a constant need for admiration, a lack of understanding or concern for others' feelings, and a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, or beauty. They often have fragile self-esteem that is easily bruised, leading to defensive and sometimes aggressive reactions when their self-image is challenged.

    Some common traits and behaviors associated with narcissism include:

    1  . Grandiosity: A narcissist may have an exaggerated sense of their own achievements and talents. They often believe they are unique and superior to others.

    2. Need for Admiration: Narcissists crave constant attention, praise, and admiration from others. They may seek out situations where they can be the center of attention.

    3. Lack of Empathy: Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others. Narcissists struggle to recognize or care about the emotions of others, as they are primarily focused on themselves.

    4. Manipulation: Narcissists can be skilled manipulators, using charm and charisma to control and exploit others to meet their own needs and desires.

    5. Entitlement: Due to their inflated self-importance, narcissists often believe they are entitled to special treatment and may become angry or frustrated if they don't receive it.

    6. Envy and Jealousy: Despite their belief in their own superiority, narcissists can feel envious of others' achievements and often react negatively to perceived competition.

    7. Lack of Authenticity: Narcissists may present a carefully crafted facade to the world, projecting an image of confidence and success that may not align with their true feelings of insecurity.

It's important to note that not everyone with narcissistic traits has a diagnosable personality disorder. Some degree of narcissism is present in most people, and in certain contexts, it can even be healthy. However, when these traits become extreme and interfere with a person's ability to maintain healthy relationships and function in society, they may indicate the presence of narcissistic personality disorder.


* ## **Narcissistic**
   
   Is an adjective used to describe individuals who have an excessive or exaggerated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. People who are narcissistic often prioritize themselves over others and seek constant validation and attention. This term is derived from the myth of Narcissus in Greek mythology, who fell in love with his own reflection.

*"Her narcissistic tendencies, along with his, made it difficult for her to form genuine connections with others, as she was always focused on herself and her own needs."*

* ## **Ostentatious**

    "Ostentatious" is an adjective used to describe something that is characterized by an extravagant display, showy behavior, or excessive display of wealth, often with the intention of attracting attention or impressing others. When something is described as ostentatious, it means that it's meant to be noticed and is often associated with a lack of subtlety.

*"Their ostentatious, falsely opulent tendencies are a clear reflection of the owner's desire to showcase their wealth and status to the world."*


* ## **Corrupt**

   Is the adjective I would use that best describes something or someone who I know to be dishonest, immoral, or willing to engage in unethical behavior, often for personal gain or to achieve an unfair advantage. It can refer to a wide range of situations, from corrupt institutions to individuals who engage in bribery, fraud, or abuse of power.

*"The corrupt individuals in question are still causing, or have caused, significant harm to both me and the person I loved. Without a doubt, they have painted a false and dark picture of me, spreading lies and conjecture throughout the community. As a result, they have eroded all of my trust."*


* ## **Subterfuge** 
   
   Refers to a deceitful strategy or trick used to achieve a goal or deceive someone. It involves intentionally concealing, distorting, or manipulating information or actions to achieve a hidden purpose. Subterfuge often involves tactics designed to mislead or manipulate others without their awareness.

*"The spy used subterfuge to infiltrate the enemy's ranks by pretending to be a harmless civilian while gathering critical information."*


* ## **Espionage**

    * In the context of espionage, a `"mole"` refers to an individual who has been strategically placed within an organization, company, government agency, or similar entity with the intention of secretly gathering information, transmitting it to another party, or influencing the organization's activities in favor of the party that placed the mole.

    * `Moles` are often recruited for their access to sensitive or classified information, and they work covertly to avoid detection while carrying out their espionage activities. The goal of a mole is to remain hidden and build a facade of loyalty to the organization they infiltrate, all while serving the interests of their true handlers.

    * `Moles` can be a significant threat to national security, corporate interests, and any organization's operations, as their activities can compromise confidential data, strategies, and plans. Uncovering and identifying `moles` requires sophisticated counterintelligence efforts.


* ## **Walter Mitty** 
   
    * It refers to a fictional character created by American author James Thurber, but the best description for the individual or individuals I'm referring to in this context. This character is most famously known for appearing in Thurber's short story titled 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,' which was first published in The New Yorker magazine in 1939."

    * Walter Mitty is depicted as a mild-mannered, daydream-prone individual who escapes his mundane and uneventful life by immersing himself in elaborate fantasies and daydreams. In his fantasies, he envisions himself as a daring and heroic figure, engaging in exciting and adventurous activities. However, in reality, he is often pushed around by his overbearing wife and generally lacks self-confidence.

    * "Throughout the story, Mitty goes through a series of daydreams in which he takes on various roles such as a brave pilot, a skilled surgeon, a courtroom hero, and more. These daydreams provide him with an escape from the routine and dullness of his everyday existence.

    * The story blends Mitty's vivid imagination with his real-life struggles and serves as a commentary on the contrast between personal fantasies and the often unremarkable reality that many people experience. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" has become a classic piece of American literature and has been adapted into various forms of media, including films, plays, and more.


* ## **Spitefulness**

*   **"Spite"** is a noun that refers to a feeling of ill will, malice, or the desire to hurt, annoy, or upset someone else. It can also refer to actions, remarks, or behavior that are motivated by such feelings. When someone acts out of spite, they are intentionally doing something to cause harm or discomfort to another person, often as a result of personal animosity or resentment.

*For example, if someone refuses to help you simply because they don't like you, that action could be driven by spite. Similarly, if someone makes a hurtful comment about you without any valid reason, that comment could be considered spiteful.*

*   **"spitefulness"** It's the noun form of the adjective "spiteful." It refers to the quality or state of being filled with or characterized by a desire to harm, annoy, or upset others. People might exhibit spitefulness through their actions, words, or behavior when they act with malicious intent or a desire to hurt others.


*   **"Spiteful"** is the adjective I have used to describe someone or something that is filled with or characterized by a desire to harm, annoy, or upset others. It often implies a sense of malice or ill will.

*For example, if someone acts in a "spiteful" manner, they may be intentionally trying to hurt someone emotionally or damage their reputation. Similarly, a "spiteful" remark or action is one that is intended to cause harm or distress.*


* ## **Liars**
A liar is someone who intentionally presents false information or deceptive statements as if they were true. While it's important to note that not all liars will exhibit all these characteristics, here are some common traits often associated with individuals who engage in dishonesty:

1. **Inconsistent Storytelling**: Liars often struggle to maintain consistency in their stories because they are making up details as they go along. This can lead to contradictions when questioned over time.

2. **Avoidance of Eye Contact**: People who lie might avoid making direct eye contact, as they may feel uncomfortable or guilty about their deception.

3. **Body Language**: Liars can display nervous behaviors such as fidgeting, touching their face, or shifting weight from foot to foot. These signs of anxiety can indicate that they are withholding the truth.

4. **Defensiveness**: When confronted with skepticism or questioning, a liar might become defensive or overly emotional in an attempt to divert attention from their falsehoods.

5. **Unnecessary Details**: To make their stories more convincing, liars often provide an excessive amount of irrelevant or unnecessary details. This can be an attempt to distract from the main deception.

6. **Storytelling Adaptations**: If a liar is caught in a lie, they may modify their story or offer new explanations to try to reconcile inconsistencies.

7. **Delay or Hesitation in Response**: While a liar may need a moment to fabricate a response, they could also exhibit hesitation in answering straightforward questions.

8. **Changes in Vocal Tone**: A liar's voice might change in pitch, tone, or speed due to anxiety or the effort of maintaining deception.

9. **Grooming Behaviors**: Liars might engage in self-soothing behaviors like touching their hair, adjusting clothing, or playing with objects as a way to cope with their anxiety.

10. **Microexpressions**: These are quick, involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions. A skilled observer might detect microexpressions that conflict with the liar's spoken words.

11. **Avoidance of Specifics**: Liars might steer conversations away from specific details or refuse to provide concrete answers to avoid being caught in a lie.

12. **Overemphasis**: To make their statements more convincing, liars might overuse phrases like "I swear," "honestly," or "believe me."

13. **Sudden Changes in Behavior**: People who are lying might exhibit changes in behavior, such as becoming overly friendly or cooperative, to divert attention from their deception.

***It's important to note that these traits are not foolproof indicators of lying. Some people might exhibit these behaviors due to nervousness, anxiety, or other reasons unrelated to deception. Accusing someone of lying solely based on these characteristics can lead to misunderstandings. It's usually best to consider multiple factors and context before drawing conclusions about someone's honesty.***


* ## **Exaggeration**

Refers to the act of making something appear larger, more important, more intense, or more significant than it actually is. It involves overstating or overemphasizing certain aspects of a situation, story, or description in order to create a stronger effect, evoke emotions, or emphasize a point. Exaggeration can be used for comedic effect, to make a point more memorable, or to enhance the impact of a narrative. However, excessive or inappropriate exaggeration can sometimes lead to misinformation or misunderstandings.

***A person who exaggerates tends to amplify or embellish details, events, or circumstances beyond their actual significance. This behavior can manifest in various ways, and several characteristics are often associated with individuals who have a tendency to exaggerate:***

1. **Attention-Seeking**: People who exaggerate might do so to capture attention and stand out in a group. By embellishing their stories, they hope to make themselves appear more interesting or important.

2. **Dramatic Language**: Exaggerators often use dramatic language and hyperbole to emphasize their point. They may use words like "never," "always," "worst," "best," and other extreme descriptors to make their stories more compelling.

3. **Inconsistent Details**: When someone exaggerates, their stories might not remain consistent over time. This is because they might struggle to remember the specific details they've added to the narrative.

4. **Unbelievable Claims**: Exaggerators might make claims that are hard to believe due to their extreme nature. These claims can include extraordinary achievements, improbable experiences, or constant involvement in unique situations.

5. **Seeking Validation**: Exaggerators often seek validation from others. By making their experiences sound more remarkable, they hope to gain approval or admiration from those around them.

6. **One-Upmanship**: Exaggerators may engage in a form of one-upmanship, always trying to outdo others in terms of experiences, achievements, or hardships. They want to have the most impressive or challenging story in the group.

7. **Insecurity**: Sometimes, exaggeration can stem from feelings of inadequacy or insecurity. By exaggerating their accomplishments or experiences, individuals may attempt to mask their self-perceived shortcomings.

8. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Some exaggerators might not even realize that they are stretching the truth. Over time, they may come to believe their own embellished versions of events.

9. **Social Pressure**: In certain social situations, individuals might feel pressure to fit in or be accepted. This pressure can lead them to exaggerate their experiences or stories to match the expectations of the group.

10. **Storytelling Tendency**: Exaggerators might be naturally inclined towards storytelling and creative expression. While storytelling can be positive, exaggeration becomes problematic when it crosses the line into misinformation.

It's important to note that occasional use of hyperbole or exaggeration for emphasis is common in everyday language and storytelling. However, when exaggeration becomes a habitual and compulsive behavior that distorts reality, it can lead to issues of credibility and trust in personal and professional relationships.
