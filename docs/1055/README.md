## My final report on the findings of the people who are about to be exposed. The thing that excites me the most is that they aren't even aware!

## **"You only know what you have been allowed to know".**


## "Tout sera révélé."

"Remember, all actions have consequences. We're aware of your past deeds and are observing closely. The day of reckoning may approach sooner than you think. Reflect upon your choices."

"Rappelez-vous, chaque action a des conséquences. Nous sommes au courant de vos actes passés et observons de près. Le jour du jugement pourrait arriver plus tôt que vous ne le pensez. Méditez sur vos choix."

"Memento, omne agere consequentias habet. Cognoscimus tua facta praeterita et attentius observamus. Dies ultionis propior venire potest quam suspicaris. Contemplare delectus tuos."

## *"This is a list of the most perfect words that describe the most horrible and cruelest people that I have ever had the misfortune to meet over the past 2 years."*


* ## **Pretentious** 

    Pretentious is an adjective used to describe someone or something that tries to appear more important, valuable, or sophisticated than it actually is. When something is labeled as pretentious, it often means that it comes across as affected, showy, or attempting to impress others by adopting an air of significance/superiority or complexity that is not genuine or warranted.

    For example, if someone uses overly complex language in casual conversations to sound more intellectual, or if an artwork seems to be intentionally difficult to understand without offering much substance, they might be considered pretentious.

Keep in mind that labeling something as pretentious can sometimes be subjective and influenced by individual perceptions and biases. What one person considers pretentious, another might find genuinely engaging, meaningful, or, in my experience, ostentatious and full of nonsense and quiet frankly **SHIT!**


* ## **Narcissistic**
   
   Is an adjective used to describe individuals who have an excessive or exaggerated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. People who are narcissistic often prioritize themselves over others and seek constant validation and attention. This term is derived from the myth of Narcissus in Greek mythology, who fell in love with his own reflection.

*"Her narcissistic tendencies, along with his, made it difficult for her to form genuine connections with others, as she was always focused on herself and her own needs."*



* ## **Ostentatious**

    "Ostentatious" is an adjective used to describe something that is characterized by an extravagant display, showy behavior, or excessive display of wealth, often with the intention of attracting attention or impressing others. When something is described as ostentatious, it means that it's meant to be noticed and is often associated with a lack of subtlety.

*"Their ostentatious, falsely opulent tendencies are a clear reflection of the owner's desire to showcase their wealth and status to the world."*


* ## **Corrupt**

   Is the adjective I would use that best describes something or someone who I know to be dishonest, immoral, or willing to engage in unethical behavior, often for personal gain or to achieve an unfair advantage. It can refer to a wide range of situations, from corrupt institutions to individuals who engage in bribery, fraud, or abuse of power.

*"The corrupt individuals in question are still causing, or have caused, significant harm to both me and the person I loved. Without a doubt, they have painted a false and dark picture of me, spreading lies and conjecture throughout the community. As a result, they have eroded all of my trust."*


* ## **Subterfuge** 
   
   Refers to a deceitful strategy or trick used to achieve a goal or deceive someone. It involves intentionally concealing, distorting, or manipulating information or actions to achieve a hidden purpose. Subterfuge often involves tactics designed to mislead or manipulate others without their awareness.

*"The spy used subterfuge to infiltrate the enemy's ranks by pretending to be a harmless civilian while gathering critical information."*


* ## **Espionage**

    * In the context of espionage, a `"mole"` refers to an individual who has been strategically placed within an organization, company, government agency, or similar entity with the intention of secretly gathering information, transmitting it to another party, or influencing the organization's activities in favor of the party that placed the mole.

    * Moles are often recruited for their access to sensitive or classified information, and they work covertly to avoid detection while carrying out their espionage activities. The goal of a mole is to remain hidden and build a facade of loyalty to the organization they infiltrate, all while serving the interests of their true handlers.

    * Moles can be a significant threat to national security, corporate interests, and any organization's operations, as their activities can compromise confidential data, strategies, and plans. Uncovering and identifying moles requires sophisticated counterintelligence efforts.


* ## **Walter Mitty** 
   
    * It refers to a fictional character created by American author James Thurber, but the best description for the individual or individuals I'm referring to in this context. This character is most famously known for appearing in Thurber's short story titled 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,' which was first published in The New Yorker magazine in 1939."

    * Walter Mitty is depicted as a mild-mannered, daydream-prone individual who escapes his mundane and uneventful life by immersing himself in elaborate fantasies and daydreams. In his fantasies, he envisions himself as a daring and heroic figure, engaging in exciting and adventurous activities. However, in reality, he is often pushed around by his overbearing wife and generally lacks self-confidence.

    * "Throughout the story, Mitty goes through a series of daydreams in which he takes on various roles such as a brave pilot, a skilled surgeon, a courtroom hero, and more. These daydreams provide him with an escape from the routine and dullness of his everyday existence.

    * The story blends Mitty's vivid imagination with his real-life struggles and serves as a commentary on the contrast between personal fantasies and the often unremarkable reality that many people experience. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" has become a classic piece of American literature and has been adapted into various forms of media, including films, plays, and more.


* ## **Spitefulness**

*   **"Spite"** is a noun that refers to a feeling of ill will, malice, or the desire to hurt, annoy, or upset someone else. It can also refer to actions, remarks, or behavior that are motivated by such feelings. When someone acts out of spite, they are intentionally doing something to cause harm or discomfort to another person, often as a result of personal animosity or resentment.

*For example, if someone refuses to help you simply because they don't like you, that action could be driven by spite. Similarly, if someone makes a hurtful comment about you without any valid reason, that comment could be considered spiteful.*

*   **"spitefulness"** It's the noun form of the adjective "spiteful." It refers to the quality or state of being filled with or characterized by a desire to harm, annoy, or upset others. People might exhibit spitefulness through their actions, words, or behavior when they act with malicious intent or a desire to hurt others.


*   **"Spiteful"** is the adjective I have used to describe someone or something that is filled with or characterized by a desire to harm, annoy, or upset others. It often implies a sense of malice or ill will.

*For example, if someone acts in a "spiteful" manner, they may be intentionally trying to hurt someone emotionally or damage their reputation. Similarly, a "spiteful" remark or action is one that is intended to cause harm or distress.*
