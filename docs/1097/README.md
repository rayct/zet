# VI/VIM RELATED

In Vim, you can open a terminal directly within Vim itself using a feature called "terminal mode." This allows you to run shell commands and interact with the terminal without leaving Vim. Here's how you can open a terminal in Vim:

1. **Open Vim**: Launch Vim by typing `vim` in your terminal and pressing Enter.

2. **Switch to Terminal mode**:
   - Press `Ctrl + w` followed by `:term`. This will split the window and open a terminal at the bottom.

3. **Use the terminal**:
   - You are now in a terminal within Vim. You can run any shell commands or programs as you would in a regular terminal.

4. **Return to Vim**: To go back to regular Vim mode from the terminal, press `Ctrl + w` followed by `Ctrl + w` again.

5. **Resize the terminal window** (optional):
   - If you want to resize the terminal window, you can do so by pressing `Ctrl + w` followed by `<` or `>` to decrease or increase the width, or `Ctrl + w` followed by `+` or `-` to increase or decrease the height.

6. **Exit the terminal window**:
   - To close the terminal window, you can either exit the shell (e.g., type `exit` and press Enter) or press `Ctrl + d`.

Using the terminal within Vim allows for a seamless workflow where you can edit files and run shell commands without leaving the Vim environment.
