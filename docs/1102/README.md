# Persona non grata

**"Persona non grata"** is a Latin phrase that translates to "an unwelcome person." It is typically used to describe an individual who is not accepted or welcomed in a particular place, organization, or community due to their actions, behavior, beliefs, or other reasons.

In diplomatic terms, declaring someone persona non grata is a formal statement by a government indicating that a foreign diplomat or representative is no longer welcome in the host country. This can be due to actions or behavior deemed unacceptable by the host country's government.

In broader usage, the term can refer to anyone who is not welcome or accepted in a specific situation, social group, or organization. The reasons for someone being labeled persona non grata can vary widely, from violating rules or norms to engaging in unethical or unacceptable behavior.
