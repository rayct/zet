**Full Course by Safe.AI Founder on Machine Learning & Ethics (Center for AI Safety)**

ML systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. As with other powerful technologies, safety for ML should be a leading research priority. In this course we‚Äôll discuss how researchers can shape the process that will lead to strong AI systems and steer that process in a safer direction. We‚Äôll cover various technical topics to reduce existential risks (X-Risks) from strong AI, namely withstanding hazards (‚ÄúRobustness‚Äù), identifying hazards (‚ÄúMonitoring‚Äù), reducing inherent ML system hazards (‚ÄúAlignment‚Äù), and reducing systemic hazards (‚ÄúSystemic Safety‚Äù). At the end, we will zoom out and discuss additional abstract existential hazards and discuss how to increase safety without unintended side effects.
