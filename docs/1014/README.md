## DEFINITION
### Managed Services Provider (MSP)

Alexander S. Gillis, Technical Writer and EditorJohn Moore, Industry Editor
What is a managed service provider?
A managed service provider (MSP) is a third-party company that remotely manages a customer's information technology (IT) infrastructure and end-user systems. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), nonprofits and government agencies hire MSPs to perform a defined set of day-to-day management services. These services may include network and infrastructure management, security and monitoring.

MSPs often handle management services on a daily basis so customer organizations can focus on improving their services without worrying about extended system downtimes or service interruptions.

## **Wikipedia**
Managed services is the practice of outsourcing the responsibility for maintaining, and anticipating need for, a range of processes and functions, ostensibly for the purpose of improved operations and reduced budgetary expenditures through the reduction of directly-employed staff.[1][2][3] It is an alternative to the break/fix or on-demand outsourcing model where the service provider performs on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done.
