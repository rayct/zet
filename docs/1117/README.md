# Authenticated but not Authorized

"Authenticated but not authorized" is a concept commonly used in the context of computer security and access control. It refers to a situation where a user or entity has successfully proven their identity, typically through a login process (authentication), but is not granted the necessary permissions or rights to access or perform a specific action (authorization).

A breakdown of the key differences between these two terms:

1. Authentication:
   - Authentication is the process of verifying a user's or entity's identity. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be.
   - This can involve providing a username and password, a fingerprint scan, a smart card, or any other method that confirms identity.
   - Successful authentication means the system has confirmed the user's identity.

2. Authorization:
   - Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform after they have been authenticated.
   - It involves defining and enforcing permissions, rights, and privileges based on the user's identity and role.
   - Successful authorization means the user has the necessary permissions to perform specific actions or access particular resources.

The key point is that being authenticated only verifies who you are, while being authorized specifies what you are allowed to do. "Authenticated but not authorized" implies that you've proven your identity, but you do not have the necessary permissions to perform a certain action or access certain data or resources. This is an essential concept in access control to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information or performing actions they shouldn't have rights to.
