# Welcome!

Ramblings from **Raymond C. TURNER**.

"There's No Place Like 127.0.0.1"

"I will be documenting my journey through Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, IoT, and security, as a polyglot and autodidact. The primary focus will be on AI safety and polyglot programming with the goal of publishing a book or two."

"Getting a book picked as the center of a course is the holy grail of publishing."

"I'll eventually be transitioning to a more advanced theme. For now, I'm using the default MKDocs-Material theme to demonstrate simple site generation without any additional hackery."

## Experience

"My name is Raymond Turner, and I live on the South Coast of the UK. I am a 51-year-old autodidact and polyglot, documenting and sharing my journey with the community in the field of Computer Science with a passion for AI/ML. Initially, my background was in automotive mechanical and electrical work. However, I transitioned to electronics repair, assembly, and calibration for various manufacturers in the Marine and Defense sectors.

Over time, I progressed to wiring Electrical Control Systems, process control panels, and instrument testing and calibration, with some on-site and on-premises support and installations. It was during these roles, while collaborating with design engineers and working with software control systems, that I developed a keen interest in designing and coding for automation. Since then, I have fully immersed myself in the world of computers, engaging in activities such as building, repairing, customizing, and setting up networks. I am now eagerly working towards establishing my perfect homelab, having acquired most of the required hardware over the years, with the exception of obtaining a cabinet. Despite not having formal certifications, I have dedicated numerous years to these pursuits and have discovered that software and tech are my true passions.

## Goals

"My particular interests are in Operations, IoT, AI, Machine learning, Cloud Infrastructure as Code computing, Security, Networking Administration, and Mastering everthing Linux right down to the kernel. I have been learning to code on and off since 2012. My first real creation was in web design, where I designed and coded a production [scaffolding website](https://www.tailoredscaffolding.co.uk/) from scratch for my nephew, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, managing my responsibilities as a full-time carer for my friend over the past 10 years presented some challenges. Unfortunately, my role as a carer came to an end in March 2023 when I lost my best friend of 29 years, who very sadly passed away due to his ongoing health complications. I learned so much from him; he held an HND in Electronics Design Engineering and was also a qualified electrician and plumber. He was my mentor and a steadfast pillar of society."

"Since then, I have resumed my coding journey full-time, beginning with Harvard's CS50 Computer Science and AI program in parallel with Calculus and College Algebra. I am focusing on my polyglot programming in C, Python, GO, Perl, Ruby, and BASH. My plan is to continue advancing in Computer Science and AI/ML, IoT, and Security. 

## Hobbies and Interests
* Science, Pyshics, Maths, Tech and Astronomy
* Long walks and hikes
* Photography (Architecture, Wildlife, People and Basically everything in general)
* Dancing (HipHop, Northern Soul, Breakdance, and everykind of Dancing)
* Biking (On and Off Road)
* Good Music is an Absoulute essential
* Keen level 3 Drummer
* Martial Arts
* Love kind beautiful selfless, and loyal people
* My opinions are my own

## Publishing
Getting a book picked as the center of a course is the holy grail of publishing. If I do it right, I can create an approachable book or two that also checks the 'instructional technology' boxes required for college courses to pick it."
