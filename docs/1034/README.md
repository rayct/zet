***Live on the CMD Line!***

Ramblings from **Raymond C. TURNER**.

### Documenting My Journey into Computer Science and Technology!
I'll be Eventually transitioning to a better more advanced theme.
For now, I'm using the default MKDocs-Material theme to demonstrate simple site generation without any additional hackery.

## Experience

"My name is Raymond Turner, and I live on the South Coast of the UK. I am a 51-year-old autodidact, and polyglot documenting and sharing my journey with the community into the tech industry. Initially, my background was in automotive mechanical and electrical work. However, I transitioned to electronics repair, assembly, and calibration for various manufacturers in the Marine and Defense sectors.

Over time, I progressed to wiring Electrical Control Systems, process control panels, and instrument testing and calibration, with some on-site and on-premises support and installations. It was during these roles, while collaborating with design engineers and working with software control systems, that I developed a keen interest in designing and coding for automation. Since then, I have fully immersed myself in the world of computers, engaging in activities such as building, repairing, customizing, and setting up networks. I am now eagerly working towards establishing my perfect homelab, having acquired most of the required hardware over the years, with the exception of obtaining a cabinet. Despite not having formal certifications, I have dedicated numerous years to these pursuits and have discovered that software and tech are my true passions.

## Goals

My particular interests are in Operations, IoT, AI, Machine learning, Cloud Infrastructure as code computing, Security, Networking Admin and Mastering Linux and the kernel. I have been learning to code on and off since 2012. My first real creation was in web design, where I designed and coded a production **<a href="https://www.tailoredscaffolding.co.uk/" target="_blank">scaffolding website</a>** for my nephew from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, managing my responsibilities as a full-time carer for my friend over the past 10 years presented some challenges. Unfortunately, my role as a carer came to an end in March 2023 when I lost my best friend of 29 years, who very sadly passed away due to his ongoing health complications. I learned so much from him. He held an HND in Electronics Design Engineering and was also a qualified electrician and plumber. He was my mentor and a steadfast pillar of society.

Since then, I have resumed my coding journey full-time, starting with the fundamentals in Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Sciences program. I'm focused on C and Python scripting in BASH, SQL, and GIT, and the version control system. My plan is to further advance my polyglot learning program.

Additionally, I engage in freeCodeCamp, LeetCode, and Hack the Box to enhance my coding abilities.

Currently, I'm also splitting my time to expand my knowledge in Calculus and College Algebra. I am in the process of effectively mastering the command line in Linux/Unix/Windows and BASH scripting using Vi/Vim."
