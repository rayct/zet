# Talored Scaffolding
## Creating a fully functional AI chatbot in Go for a scaffolding company involves several steps, including setting up the development environment, integrating with a natural language processing (NLP) service, and defining the chatbot's behavior. Below is a high-level outline of the process:

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
   Start by setting up your development environment with Go and any necessary dependencies.

2. **Choose an NLP Service:**
   Integrate with a natural language processing service that can handle user input and extract intent and entities from the messages. Some popular NLP services include Wit.ai, Dialogflow, or Microsoft LUIS.

3. **Project Structure:**
   Organize your project into appropriate folders and files. For example:
   ```
   scaffolding-chatbot/
   ├── main.go
   ├── nlp/
   │   └── nlp_service.go
   ├── chatbot/
   │   ├── chatbot.go
   │   └── actions.go
   └── scaffolding/
       └── scaffolding_info.go
   ```

4. **Implement NLP Integration:**
   In the `nlp_service.go` file, implement functions to interact with the chosen NLP service. This involves sending user messages and receiving NLP analysis results, such as intent and entities.

5. **Define Chatbot Actions:**
   In the `actions.go` file, define various actions that the chatbot can perform based on user intents. For a scaffolding company, actions might include requesting a quote, scheduling an inspection, or providing safety information.

6. **Scaffolding Information:**
   Create a file named `scaffolding_info.go` to hold relevant information about the company's services, safety guidelines, pricing, and other details.

7. **Chatbot Logic:**
   In the `chatbot.go` file, implement the main chatbot logic. This involves processing user messages using the NLP service, determining the user's intent, and executing the appropriate action.

8. **User Interaction Loop:**
   In the `main.go` file, set up a loop to continuously interact with users. Receive user input, pass it to the NLP service for analysis, and then execute the corresponding chatbot action.

9. **Testing and Refinement:**
   Test the chatbot extensively to ensure it responds accurately to different user inputs and performs the intended actions. Refine the chatbot's behavior based on user feedback and real-world usage.

10. **Deployment:**
   Once you're satisfied with the chatbot's performance, deploy it to a server or cloud platform so that users can interact with it.

A basic example of how the code might look for the main components:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"bufio"
	"os"
	"scaffolding-chatbot/chatbot"
	"scaffolding-chatbot/nlp"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to the Scaffolding Company Chatbot!")
	
	// Initialize NLP service
	nlpService := nlp.NewNLPService()

	// Initialize chatbot
	chatbot := chatbot.NewChatbot(nlpService)

	// User interaction loop
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
		fmt.Print("You: ")
		scanner.Scan()
		userInput := scanner.Text()

		response := chatbot.ProcessMessage(userInput)
		fmt.Println("Chatbot:", response)
	}
}
```

## An Example of a `NLP` for a Scaffolding Hire Company (tailoredscaffolding.co.uk)

Certainly! Let's consider an example of how Natural Language Processing (NLP) could be applied to a scaffolding hire company's website to enhance customer interactions and streamline their services.

**Example Scenario: Booking Scaffolding**

Suppose a customer visits the scaffolding hire company's website and wants to inquire about booking scaffolding for a construction project. The company can integrate NLP to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience.

1. **User Input:** The customer interacts with a chatbot on the company's website and provides the following input:
   ```
   User: Hi, I need to rent scaffolding for a construction project. Can you help me with that?
   ```

2. **Intent Recognition:** The NLP system analyzes the user input and recognizes the intent behind the message:
   ```
   Intent: Booking Inquiry
   ```

3. **Entity Extraction:** The NLP system identifies relevant entities within the user input:
   ```
   Entities: 
   - Action: Rent
   - Equipment: Scaffolding
   - Purpose: Construction project
   ```

4. **Response Generation:** Based on the recognized intent and extracted entities, the chatbot generates a response:
   ```
   Chatbot: Hello! Thank you for considering our scaffolding services. We'd be happy to assist you with renting scaffolding for your construction project. Could you please provide us with some additional details, such as the project location, duration, and any specific requirements you have in mind?
   ```

5. **Clarification and Information Gathering:** The chatbot prompts the user for more information, guiding them to provide essential details for the booking process.

6. **User Interaction:** The conversation continues as the user provides the necessary information. The chatbot may ask follow-up questions and provide information about pricing, safety guidelines, and availability based on the user's inputs.

7. **Confirmation and Booking:** Once all required details are collected, the chatbot confirms the booking request and provides the user with a summary of the information:
   ```
   Chatbot: Thank you for providing the details. We have successfully received your request to rent scaffolding for your construction project at [Project Location]. The rental duration is [Duration]. Our team will review your request and get back to you shortly with pricing and availability information. Is there anything else we can assist you with?
   ```

By integrating NLP into the scaffolding hire company's website, customers can easily inquire about renting scaffolding and receive prompt, relevant, and accurate responses. The NLP-powered chatbot streamlines the booking process and provides a more personalized and interactive experience for customers, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and efficiency for the company.





Please note that this is a simplified outline, and you'll need to implement the details and customize the code according to your scaffolding company's specific requirements and the capabilities of the NLP service you choose to integrate. Also, remember to handle error cases, manage conversation context, and potentially integrate with external systems if needed.
