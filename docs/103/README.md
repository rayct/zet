# Talored Scaffolding
## Creating a fully functional AI chatbot in Go for a scaffolding company involves several steps, including setting up the development environment, integrating with a natural language processing (NLP) service, and defining the chatbot's behavior. Below is a high-level outline of the process:

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
   Start by setting up your development environment with Go and any necessary dependencies.

2. **Choose an NLP Service:**
   Integrate with a natural language processing service that can handle user input and extract intent and entities from the messages. Some popular NLP services include Wit.ai, Dialogflow, or Microsoft LUIS.

3. **Project Structure:**
   Organize your project into appropriate folders and files. For example:
   ```
   scaffolding-chatbot/
   ├── main.go
   ├── nlp/
   │   └── nlp_service.go
   ├── chatbot/
   │   ├── chatbot.go
   │   └── actions.go
   └── scaffolding/
       └── scaffolding_info.go
   ```

4. **Implement NLP Integration:**
   In the `nlp_service.go` file, implement functions to interact with the chosen NLP service. This involves sending user messages and receiving NLP analysis results, such as intent and entities.

5. **Define Chatbot Actions:**
   In the `actions.go` file, define various actions that the chatbot can perform based on user intents. For a scaffolding company, actions might include requesting a quote, scheduling an inspection, or providing safety information.

6. **Scaffolding Information:**
   Create a file named `scaffolding_info.go` to hold relevant information about the company's services, safety guidelines, pricing, and other details.

7. **Chatbot Logic:**
   In the `chatbot.go` file, implement the main chatbot logic. This involves processing user messages using the NLP service, determining the user's intent, and executing the appropriate action.

8. **User Interaction Loop:**
   In the `main.go` file, set up a loop to continuously interact with users. Receive user input, pass it to the NLP service for analysis, and then execute the corresponding chatbot action.

9. **Testing and Refinement:**
   Test the chatbot extensively to ensure it responds accurately to different user inputs and performs the intended actions. Refine the chatbot's behavior based on user feedback and real-world usage.

10. **Deployment:**
   Once you're satisfied with the chatbot's performance, deploy it to a server or cloud platform so that users can interact with it.

A basic example of how the code might look for the main components:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"bufio"
	"os"
	"scaffolding-chatbot/chatbot"
	"scaffolding-chatbot/nlp"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to the Scaffolding Company Chatbot!")
	
	// Initialize NLP service
	nlpService := nlp.NewNLPService()

	// Initialize chatbot
	chatbot := chatbot.NewChatbot(nlpService)

	// User interaction loop
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
		fmt.Print("You: ")
		scanner.Scan()
		userInput := scanner.Text()

		response := chatbot.ProcessMessage(userInput)
		fmt.Println("Chatbot:", response)
	}
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified outline, and you'll need to implement the details and customize the code according to your scaffolding company's specific requirements and the capabilities of the NLP service you choose to integrate. Also, remember to handle error cases, manage conversation context, and potentially integrate with external systems if needed.
