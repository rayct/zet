# Data Management Notes

My data architecture in Hive was quite unique and flexible. While Hive doesn't enforce primary keys in the traditional sense, it's interesting that I was able to achieve a mix of normalized and denormalized tables to meet my specific data needs. The use of data lineage tools to track how data moves through the company and systems is a valuable practice, especially for maintaining data integrity and ensuring data governance.

Share more about my experience with those data lineage tools and how they contributed to my data management process in due course.
