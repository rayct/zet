# A valid GitHub release tag follows a specific naming convention and can include version numbers, release names, and other identifiers. The format of a typical valid GitHub release tag is:

```
vX.Y.Z
```

Here's what each part of the tag represents:

- `v`: This is a prefix indicating that it's a version tag. It's a common convention to prepend a lowercase 'v' to the version numbers to distinguish them from other tags or branches.
- `X`: Major version number. It represents significant updates or changes that may not be backward-compatible.
- `Y`: Minor version number. It indicates smaller updates, new features, or improvements that maintain backward compatibility.
- `Z`: Patch version number. This is used for bug fixes, minor updates, or other small changes that don't introduce new features.

For example, a valid GitHub release tag could be `v1.2.3`, where:

- `v`: Prefix indicating a version tag.
- `1`: Major version number.
- `2`: Minor version number.
- `3`: Patch version number.

This naming convention helps users quickly understand the significance of the release and the changes it brings. It's important to note that while this format is a common convention, GitHub itself doesn't enforce any specific naming rules for release tags. However, following established conventions can help maintain consistency and clarity within your repository.
