* Hi

* Hi * Grace

* * Grace
Hi, you've been transferred to me, let me first pull up your account information and access your details.

As checked I see the Illustrator plan renews on /18 Apr 2024. However, We send out an email a month prior the renewal date which is on the 11th month allowing you 30 days of time if you wish to continue for the  next term.

My friend who I lived with and cared for has just passed away and I no longer use the i, I can not afford it and was hoping you would waiver the cancellation fee please.

* * Grace
Ray, I am sorry for your loss and will help you. May I know if this account belongs to you or your friend?

Me. But It was for him.

* Grace
Ray, I understand that you wish to cancel the plan and will help you. Before you make a decision on the cancellation, I see that there are 3 free months on your subscription that haven't been applied yet. If you wish to continue, I can add those to your account and you wouldn't have to pay for the next 3 months which is Aug, Sep and Oct allowing you to save  GBP 59.91. How does that sound to you?

Can you give me 3 months for free and then reduce the plan by 30% Please

* Grace
Ray, How about I help you switch the plan to discounted price of GBP 16.18 VAT included + 3 free months?

Can you make it GBP 15.18 VAT included + 3 free months please

* Grace
Ray, I would really love to help you with that price if it was available but the best price we have is GBP 16.18 which is VAT included.

can you check with your supervisor please

GBP 15.18 VAT included + 3 free months please would really help me out.

* Grace
Ray, It is not that I do not want to help you with the price. In the entire Adobe plan pricing module we do not have  lesser than GBP 16.18.

What if I can escalate my case to a supervisor or higher-level support, given my circumstance.

* Grace
Ray, I believe we are having a miscommunication here. It is not that I cannot provide you with that price. But that price does not exist.

OK! So if i switch the plan to discounted price of GBP 16.18 VAT included + 3 free months? when will it expire?

* Grace
The plan will start from today.


As we make the changes I will be cancelling the current plan with the prorate refund  GBP 1.33 which will be credited within 5/7 business days and then activate the discounted plan wherein the amount of GBP 16.18 plan will be charged today and then 2nd, 3rd and 4th month will be free. Shall I proceed with the same?

Ok! yes Please.

* Grace
May I proceed with the same card on file?

Yes

* Grace
Please go through the T&C and reply with " I AGREE" on the chat


Subscription Terms:


Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel. You authorize us to store your payment method(s) and to automatically charge your payment method(s) every month until you cancel. We will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your plan, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT or GST if the rate does not include it), every month of your annual contract until you cancel.


We may change your plan’s rate each annual renewal term, and we will notify you of any rate change with the option to cancel. If the applicable VAT or GST rate (or other included tax or duty) changes during your one-year term, we will accordingly adjust the tax-inclusive price for your plan mid-term on your next billing date.


If your primary payment method fails, you authorize us to charge any other payment method in your account. If you have no

t provided us a backup payment method(s) and you fail to provide payment, or if all payment methods in your account fail, we may suspend your subscription. You can edit your payment information anytime in your Adobe Account page.


For European Economic Area customers, your bank may require you to authenticate your initial purchase using a password, a one-time code sent to your mobile number, or biometric recognition. When you authenticate, you also authorize us to charge your payment method for your additional purchases without providing us further payment information or other instructions (i.e., we will initiate future payments independently). Such additional purchases may occur when we automatically charge your payment method in connection with a recurring subscription or when you add or change licenses or products.


Cancellation Terms:


You can cancel your subscription anytime via your Adobe Account page or by contacting Customer Support*. If you cancel within 14 days of your initial order, you’ll be fully

refunded. Should you cancel after 14 days, you’ll be charged a lump sum amount of 50% of your remaining contract obligation and your service will continue until the end of that month’s billing period.

3:27 PM
Can you explain this part of the Agreement. I thought you sent out a reminder email prior to renewal: "Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel."

* Grace
Ray, That was for the old plan and this is a new plan with discounted price.

So you do send out a subscription reminder email toward the end.?

* Grace
We send out an email a month prior the renewal date which is on the 11th month allowing you 30 days of time if you wish to continue for the  next term.

I'm bit concerned with the T&C above it states "Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel. ". When do you notify me of the Annual plan end date?

* Grace
There is an email reminder a month prior the renewal date.

It's the "Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel." part I'm Concerned about

I'm referring to the entire annual plan end date, not the monthly email reminder.

* Grace
Ray, You already have a photography plan where a renewal email is being sent every 11th month of the tenure and the same way it will be for the Illustrator as well.

Can you explain this in T&C part for me. "Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel."?

It states without notice.

3:39 PM
* Grace
Ray, I would like to inform that the plan is an annual plan with monthly billing and will be renewed automatically. However, there will be an email reminder on the 11th month. Also, I will forward this detail to the team to look onto the details. Thank you!

Ok! Shall I hold then?

* Grace
Ray, If you are not comfortable with this offer. I can add 3 free months on your existing plan allowing the bills for Aug, Sep and Oct to be free. May I know how you wish to proceed?

OK! So proceed with the plan to discounted price of GBP 16.18 VAT included + 3 free months.

* Grace
Thank you! Please allow me few minutes while I  make the changes.

Ok! Thank you.

* Grace
Thank you for your patience. I have changed the plan to the discounted price plan and also added 3 free months as well as an email has been sent as confirmation for the same. Next Billing date :  15 Dec 2023 Next renewal date:  15 Aug 2024


Is there anything else I can help you with?

No Thank you I really appreciate your compassion in this situation.

I hope I haven't stressed you too much. Enjoy your day. Best wishes.

3:58 PM
* Grace
Not at all.  You're Welcome! Happy to help. You may receive an email with a survey link. Please take a moment to rate your experience and help us improve. Thanks!

Ok! All the best and Take care Good bye.
