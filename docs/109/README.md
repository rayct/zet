# Procedural programming

Procedural programming fundamentally implies performing the individual tasks (or groups of tasks) of a procedure, sometimes based on certain conditions (called "state" formally). Some people call this "flow control" or "boolean logic" since true or false conditions dictate what happens. Hence another name "conditional programming". Think "if-then" (instead of, for example, "when-then").
