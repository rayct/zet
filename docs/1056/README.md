## Go's strict typing

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```
The Go code provided above for the simple swap function is indeed a bit repetitive due to the need to repeat the type declaration for the return values. This is a characteristic of Go's strict and explicit type system.

Other programming languages, like Python, allow for more concise type hinting or provide features like tuple destructuring that can make the code less repetitive in cases like this.

However, it's important to note that Go's explicitness and strict typing also come with benefits, particularly in terms of code readability and avoiding ambiguity. The trade-off is that it can lead to more verbosity in certain cases, like the one you've highlighted.

So, while your observation is valid, it's also a reflection of Go's design principles and the trade-offs it makes in terms of code readability, maintainability, and type safety. Different languages make different trade-offs, and the choice of language often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the development team.
