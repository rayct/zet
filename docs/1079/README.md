# Text-to-Speech (TTS) - 1
## C

Creating a full-fledged text-to-speech (TTS) program from scratch in C is a complex task that typically involves using external libraries and APIs, as well as knowledge of audio processing and synthesis. However, I have provide a simplified example of a basic TTS program in C using the `espeak` library, which is a compact open-source TTS engine that can be used for simple text-to-speech tasks.

Before proceeding, make sure you have `espeak` installed on your system. You can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get` on Ubuntu or `brew` on macOS).

Here's a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <espeak/speak_lib.h>

int main()
{
    if (espeak_Initialize(AUDIO_OUTPUT_PLAYBACK, 0, NULL, 0) < 0)
    {
        printf("Failed to initialize eSpeak.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    const char *text = "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in C.";
    espeak_Synth(text, strlen(text) + 1, 0, POS_CHARACTER, 0, espeakCHARS_AUTO, NULL, NULL);
    espeak_Synchronize();

    espeak_Terminate();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. We include the necessary headers for working with `espeak`.
2. We initialize the `espeak` engine using `espeak_Initialize()`. The `AUDIO_OUTPUT_PLAYBACK` argument specifies the audio output type.
3. We provide a text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.
4. We use `espeak_Synth()` to synthesize the speech from the text.
5. Finally, we clean up and terminate the `espeak` engine using `espeak_Terminate()`.

Compile and run the program using a C compiler:

```bash
gcc tts_example.c -o tts_example -lespeak
./tts_example
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't cover more advanced features of TTS systems. For more advanced TTS capabilities, you might consider using more feature-rich libraries or cloud-based TTS APIs like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Text to Speech, which provide more natural-sounding and customizable speech synthesis.

## GO

Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a text-to-speech program in Go using the "github.com/go-ego/tts" library. Before you proceed, make sure you have the library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
go get github.com/go-ego/tts
```

Here's the equivalent program in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/go-ego/tts"
)

func main() {
    // Create a TTS instance
    speaker := tts.New()
    
    // Initialize the TTS engine
    err := speaker.Init(tts.Espeak)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to initialize TTS: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    
    // Text to be converted to speech
    text := "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in Go."
    
    // Synthesize and play the speech
    err = speaker.Speak(text)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to speak text: %v\n", err)
    }
    
    // Close the TTS engine
    speaker.Close()
}
```

In this Go example:

1. We import the necessary packages, including the "github.com/go-ego/tts" package.
2. We create a TTS instance using `tts.New()`.
3. We initialize the TTS engine with the "Espeak" backend using `speaker.Init(tts.Espeak)`.
4. We provide the text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.
5. We use `speaker.Speak()` to synthesize and play the speech.
6. Finally, we close the TTS engine using `speaker.Close()`.

Compile and run the program:

```bash
go run tts_example.go
```

This Go example provides a basic TTS functionality using the "github.com/go-ego/tts" library. For more advanced text-to-speech capabilities, you may want to explore other TTS libraries or cloud-based TTS services available for Go.

## Python

Certainly! Here's a simple example of a text-to-speech program in Python using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library, which allows you to convert text into speech using Google Translate's TTS engine. You'll need to install the `gTTS` library before running the code:

```bash
pip install gTTS
```

Here's the Python code:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os

# Text to be converted to speech
text = "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in Python."

# Create a gTTS object
tts = gTTS(text)

# Save the generated speech to a file (optional)
tts.save("output.mp3")

# Play the generated speech (optional)
os.system("mpg321 output.mp3")  # You may need to install mpg321 if not already installed

# Alternatively, you can play the speech directly without saving it
# tts.save("output.mp3")
# os.system("mpg321 output.mp3")

# Clean up the temporary speech file (optional)
os.remove("output.mp3")
```

In this Python code:

1. We import the necessary libraries, including `gTTS` for text-to-speech conversion.
2. We provide the text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.
3. We create a `gTTS` object with the text.
4. We can optionally save the generated speech to an MP3 file using `tts.save("output.mp3")`.
5. We can optionally play the generated speech using the `os.system()` function. Make sure you have a command-line MP3 player like `mpg321` installed for this to work.
6. Optionally, you can clean up the temporary speech file if you choose to save it.

Run the Python script:

```bash
python tts_example.py
```

This Python example provides a basic text-to-speech functionality using the `gTTS` library, which is simple to use for quick TTS tasks. If you need more advanced TTS capabilities, you may consider using other Python libraries or cloud-based TTS services like the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

# Text-to-Speech (TTS) - 4
## C#

To create a new console application in a specified folder, type:\
 `dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/Text-to-Speech`

A simple example of a text-to-speech program in C# using the `System.Speech.Synthesis` namespace, which is part of the .NET Framework. You don't need to install any additional libraries for this example, as the `System.Speech.Synthesis` namespace is included in .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Speech.Synthesis;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a SpeechSynthesizer instance
        using (SpeechSynthesizer synth = new SpeechSynthesizer())
        {
            // Text to be converted to speech
            string text = "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in C#.";

            try
            {
                // Speak the text
                synth.Speak(text);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this C# code:

1. We include the necessary namespaces, including `System` and `System.Speech.Synthesis`.

2. We create a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance, which represents the text-to-speech engine.

3. We provide the text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.

4. We use `synth.Speak(text)` to convert and speak the text.

5. We handle exceptions in case any errors occur during the speech synthesis.

Compile and run the C# program using the C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code):

```bash
csc Program.cs
Program.exe
```

This C# example provides a basic text-to-speech functionality using the built-in `System.Speech.Synthesis` namespace in .NET. If you need more advanced text-to-speech capabilities, you may explore third-party libraries or cloud-based text-to-speech services available for C#.



## To execute a C# console application on a Mac, you need to use the .NET Core SDK or the newer .NET 5 or .NET 6 SDK. Follow these steps:

1. **Install .NET SDK**:

   Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your Mac. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official .NET website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet.

2. **Write and Save Your C# Code**:

   Create a new text file with your C# code, or you can use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code. Save your C# code with a `.cs` file extension (e.g., `Program.cs`).

3. **Open Terminal**:

   Launch the Terminal application on your Mac.

4. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your C# source code file is located. For example, if your code is in the Desktop directory, you can navigate there like this:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```

5. **Compile Your C# Code**:

   Compile your C# code using the `dotnet` command. Assuming your code file is named `Program.cs`, you can compile it like this:

   ```bash
   dotnet build Program.cs
   ```

   This will create an executable file in the `bin/Debug/net5.0` (or a similar) folder.

6. **Run Your C# Application**:

   Execute your C# application using the `dotnet run` command. Replace `Program.cs` with the actual name of your compiled executable if it's different:

   ```bash
   dotnet run Program.dll
   ```

   You should see the output of your C# console application in the Terminal.

That's it! You've successfully executed your C# console application on your Mac using the .NET SDK.
