To insert an image into a Markdown (`.md`) document, you can use the following Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt Text](/home/ray/Repos/github.com/rayct/zet/docs/1076/eUpPKQvwTZUF1OIcHrMK06zGg+D3tx5gbfJUJddnrxU=.png)
```

![Alt Text](/home/ray/Repos/github.com/rayct/zet/docs/1076/eUpPKQvwTZUF1OIcHrMK06zGg+D3tx5gbfJUJddnrxU=.png)

Here's how it works:

- `Alt Text`: This is the alternative text that is displayed if the image fails to load. It is also used by screen readers for accessibility. Replace it with a brief description of the image.
- `URL`: This is the URL or path to the image file. If the image is hosted online, provide the full URL. If the image is in the same directory as your Markdown file, you can provide the relative path.

Here are two examples:

1. Inserting an image with an online URL:

```markdown
![OpenAI Logo](https://www.example.com/images/openai-logo.png)
```

2. Inserting an image with a relative path (assuming the image is in the same directory as your Markdown file):

```markdown
![Local Image](image.png)
```

Replace "OpenAI Logo" and "Local Image" with your own alt text, and replace the URLs or file names with the appropriate image source you want to use.

Remember that the exact syntax and rendering of images in Markdown may vary depending on the Markdown renderer or platform you're using, but the basic syntax shown above is widely supported.
