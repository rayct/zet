# Meanings

## **Contiguous** 
1. Refers to things that are in close proximity or touching each other without any gaps or interruptions. It is often used to describe objects, areas, or concepts that are physically connected or adjacent to each other. For example, a contiguous landmass refers to a land area that is not broken up by bodies of water, while a contiguous memory allocation in computer programming refers to a block of memory that is allocated in a single, uninterrupted chunk.

## **Cowsay**
1. `cowsay` is a text filter/command in Unix-like operating systems that generates an ASCII art representation of a cow with a speech bubble containing the provided text. It's a fun and whimsical way to display messages or text on the command line.

To use `cowsay`, you would typically enter a command like this:

```bash
cowsay Hello, world!
```

And the output might look something like this:

```
 _______
< Hello, world! >
 -------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

The cow's speech bubble contains the text "Hello, world!" in this example. The cow ASCII art and its speech bubble will adjust to fit longer or shorter text input. The `cowsay` command often comes pre-installed on many Unix-like systems, but if it's not installed on your system, you might need to install it using your package manager.

It's worth noting that there are variations and extensions of the `cowsay` command that offer different animal characters, additional features, and customizations beyond the classic cow.
