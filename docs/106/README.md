# ***GO*** - A Tour of Go
## A more detailed breakdown for 'noobs' 

## Packages - 1/17

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package main.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 1/17

1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```go
    package main
    ```
    This line defines the package name. In Go, the `main` package is special and serves as the entry point for the executable program. All Go programs must have a `main` package with a `main` function.

2. **Import Statements:**
    ```go
    import (
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
    )
    ```
    Here, the code is importing two packages: `fmt` and `math/rand`. The `fmt` package provides functions for formatting and printing text, while the `math/rand` package allows generating random numbers.

3. **Main Function:**
    ```go
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
    }
    ```
    The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. Here's what's happening within this function:

    - `fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))`: This line prints a string concatenated with a random integer generated using `rand.Intn(10)`. The `rand.Intn(10)` function call generates a random non-negative integer less than 10.

        - `rand.Intn(10)` generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).
        - The generated number is then printed along with the string "My favorite number is" using `fmt.Println`.

In summary, this program prints a message along with a randomly generated favorite number between 0 and 9 every time it is executed. The behavior is a simple example of utilizing the `fmt` and `math/rand` packages to perform basic output and random number generation in Go.


## Imports - 2/17

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```golang
import "fmt"
import "math"
```
But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 2/17

Of course! Let's break down the provided Go code in more detail:

1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```golang
    package main
    ```
    This is the declaration of the package. In Go, the `main` package is a special package name that indicates that this is an executable program, and it should have a `main()` function as its entry point.

2. **Import Statements:**
    ```golang
    import (
        "fmt"
        "math"
    )
    ```
    The code is importing two packages: `fmt` and `math`. The `fmt` package is used for formatting and printing text, and the `math` package provides various mathematical functions, including the `Sqrt` function used in this code.

3. **Main Function:**
    ```golang
    func main() {
        fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
    }
    ```
    The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. Here's what's happening within this function:

    - `fmt.Printf(...)`: This line is using the `fmt` package's `Printf` function to format and print a string. The format string is `"Now you have %g problems.\n"`, where `%g` is a placeholder for a floating-point number in a compact form.

    - `math.Sqrt(7)`: This part of the code is using the `math` package's `Sqrt` function to calculate the square root of 7. The result of this calculation is a floating-point number.

    - The `Printf` function combines the format string and the result of `math.Sqrt(7)` to create the final output string. The `%g` placeholder is replaced with the calculated square root value.

    - The newline character `\n` is added at the end of the string to start a new line after printing.

So, when you run this program, it will print the message "Now you have X problems." where X is the square root of 7, formatted as a floating-point number. The use of the `fmt` and `math` packages demonstrates the capability of formatting text and performing mathematical calculations in Go.


## Exported names - 3/17

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the `math` package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

To fix the error, rename `math.pi` to `math.Pi` and try it again.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 3/17

1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```golang
    package main
    ```
    This line defines the package name as `main`. In Go, the `main` package serves as the entry point for executable programs.

2. **Import Statements:**
    ```golang
    import (
        "fmt"
        "math"
    )
    ```
    The code is importing two packages: `fmt` and `math`. The `fmt` package is used for formatting and printing text, while the `math` package provides mathematical functions and constants.

3. **Main Function:**
    ```golang
    func main() {
        fmt.Println(math.Pi)
    }
    ```
    The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. Here's what happens within this function:

    - `fmt.Println(math.Pi)`: This line prints the value of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the `fmt.Println` function.

        - `math.Pi` refers to the π constant provided by the `math` package. It is a predefined constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

        - `fmt.Println` is used to print the value of `math.Pi` to the standard output.

In summary, this program imports the `fmt` and `math` packages, and in the `main()` function, it prints the value of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the `fmt.Println` function. The output will be the value of π, which is approximately 3.141592653589793.


## Functions - 4/17

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

(For more about why types look the way they do, see the article on Go's declaration syntax.)

<https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax>

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 4/17


Certainly! Let's break down the provided Go code step by step:

1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```golang
    package main
    ```
    This line defines the package name. Just like in the previous example, the `main` package is used as the entry point for the executable program.

2. **Import Statement:**
    ```golang
    import "fmt"
    ```
    Here, the code imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatting and printing text.

3. **add Function:**
    ```golang
    func add(x int, y int) int {
        return x + y
    }
    ```
    This section defines a function named `add`. Here's what's happening within this function:

    - `func add(x int, y int) int`: This line declares the `add` function, which takes two integer parameters (`x` and `y`) and returns an integer. The return type `int` after the parameter list indicates that the function will return an integer value.

    - `return x + y`: This line is the function's body. It calculates the sum of the two input integers (`x` and `y`) and returns the result.

4. **Main Function:**
    ```golang
    func main() {
        fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
    }
    ```
    The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. Here's what's happening within this function:

    - `fmt.Println(add(42, 13))`: This line calls the `add` function with the arguments `42` and `13`. The `add` function calculates the sum of these two numbers (`42 + 13`), which is `55`. The result (`55`) is then passed to `fmt.Println` to be printed to the console.

In summary, this program defines a function `add` that takes two integer parameters and returns their sum. The `main` function then calls the `add` function with specific arguments and prints the result using the `fmt` package. This example demonstrates how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values in Go.


## Functions continued - 5/17

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

In this example, we shortened

`x int, y int`

to

`x, y int`

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 5/17

1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```golang
    package main
    ```
    Just like in the previous example, this line defines the package name. The `main` package serves as the entry point for the executable program.

2. **Import Statement:**
    ```golang
    import "fmt"
    ```
    Here, only the `fmt` package is imported. It provides functions for formatting and printing text, which will be used in the `main` function.

3. **Function Definition:**
    ```golang
    func add(x, y int) int {
        return x + y
    }
    ```
    This block of code defines a function named `add`. Let's break down this function:

    - `func add(x, y int) int {`: This line starts the function definition. It takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and it returns an integer.
    - `return x + y`: This line calculates the sum of `x` and `y` and returns the result. This is the core logic of the `add` function.
    - `}`: This curly brace marks the end of the function definition.

4. **Main Function:**
    ```golang
    func main() {
        fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
    }
    ```
    The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts. Here's what's happening within this function:

    - `fmt.Println(add(42, 13))`: This line calls the `add` function with arguments `42` and `13`, and the result is printed using `fmt.Println`.

5. **Execution:**
    When the program is executed, the following sequence of events occurs:
    
    - The `main` function is invoked.
    - Inside the `main` function:
        - The `add` function is called with arguments `42` and `13`.
        - The `add` function calculates the sum of `42` and `13`, which is `55`.
        - The result `55` is passed to `fmt.Println`.
        - `fmt.Println` outputs the value `55` to the console.

In summary, this program demonstrates the usage of functions in Go. It defines a function `add` that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. The `main` function then calls `add` with specific arguments and prints the result. This example showcases how to define functions, pass arguments, and use the `fmt` package for output.


## Multiple results - 6/17

A function can return any number of results.

The `swap` function returns two strings.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 6/17


1. **Package Declaration:**
    ```golang
    package main
    ```
    Just like in the previous example, this line declares the package name as `main`, indicating that this is the main entry point for the executable program.

2. **Import Statement:**
    ```golang
    import "fmt"
    ```
    The code imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatting and printing text.

3. **Swap Function:**
    ```golang
    func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
        return y, x
    }
    ```
    This is the definition of the `swap` function. It takes two string arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns two strings in reverse order. In this case, it swaps the values of `x` and `y`. The function signature `(string, string)` after the function name indicates that the function returns two strings.

4. **Main Function:**
    ```golang
    func main() {
        a, b := swap("hello", "world")
        fmt.Println(a, b)
    }
    ```
    The `main` function is the entry point of the program. Here's what happens inside the `main` function:

    - `a, b := swap("hello", "world")`: This line calls the `swap` function with the arguments `"hello"` and `"world"`. The returned values are assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. Since `swap` returns two strings, both `a` and `b` are strings.

    - `fmt.Println(a, b)`: This line prints the values of `a` and `b` using the `fmt.Println` function. It will output the swapped values `"world"` and `"hello"`.

In summary, this program defines a `swap` function that swaps two string values and returns them in reverse order. Then, it calls this `swap` function with the arguments `"hello"` and `"world"`, and prints the swapped values using `fmt.Println`. The output of this program will be:

```bash
world hello
```

## Named return values - 7/17

Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.

These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
	x = sum * 4 / 9
	y = sum - x
	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(split(17))
}

```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 7/17

```golang
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return
}
```

1. **Function Declaration:**
   ```golang
   func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
   ```
   - `func`: Keyword indicating the declaration of a function.
   - `split`: Name of the function.
   - `(sum int)`: Input parameter of the function, an integer named `sum`.
   - `(x, y int)`: Return values of the function, both integers named `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculation of `x`:**
   ```golang
   x = sum * 4 / 9
   ```
   - `x`: Variable used to store the calculated value.
   - `sum * 4 / 9`: The input `sum` is multiplied by 4 and then divided by 9. The result of this calculation is assigned to the variable `x`.

3. **Calculation of `y`:**
   ```golang
   y = sum - x
   ```
   - `y`: Variable used to store the calculated value.
   - `sum - x`: The value of `x` (calculated previously) is subtracted from the input `sum`, and the result is assigned to the variable `y`.

4. **Return Statement:**
   ```golang
   return
   ```
   - The `return` statement doesn't explicitly provide return values. However, due to the function's signature `(x, y int)` specifying the return values as `x` and `y`, the values stored in these variables are automatically returned.

In essence, this function takes an integer `sum` as input, calculates two values (`x` and `y`) based on the input, and returns them. The value of `x` is obtained by performing a mathematical operation on the input, while the value of `y` is derived from the difference between the input and `x`. The function's structure uses named return values, which allows the function to automatically return the values assigned to `x` and `y`.


## Variables - 8/17

The `var` statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A `var` statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 8/17

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool
```

- `package main`: This line indicates that this file belongs to the `main` package, which is the entry point for executable Go programs.

- `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `"fmt"` package, which provides various functions for formatting and printing output.

- `var c, python, java bool`: This line declares three boolean variables named `c`, `python`, and `java`. They are all of type `bool`, which means they can only store either `true` or `false` values. These variables are declared at the package level, so they are accessible within the entire file.

```golang
func main() {
    var i int
    fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

- `func main()`: This is the main function of the program, and it's the entry point when the program is executed.

- `var i int`: Inside the `main` function, a new integer variable `i` is declared. Since it's declared within the function, it's a local variable and can only be accessed within the `main` function.

- `fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)`: This line uses the `Println` function from the `"fmt"` package to print the values of the variables `i`, `c`, `python`, and `java`, separated by spaces. Since `i` is a local variable and not explicitly initialized, its value is undefined (usually 0 or some garbage value). The `c`, `python`, and `java` variables are all global variables, so they can be accessed anywhere within the `main` package.

In summary, this program demonstrates how to declare and use variables in Go. It declares global boolean variables `c`, `python`, and `java`, and a local integer variable `i`. It then prints out the values of these variables within the `main` function. Keep in mind that the program doesn't assign specific values to the boolean variables, so their values will be their respective zero values, which is `false` in Go.


## Variables with initializers - 9/17

A `var` declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 9/17

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2
```
- This code snippet starts by declaring the package name as "main". In Go, the `main` package is special and is used for executable programs.
- The "fmt" package is imported, which provides functions to format and print text.
- The line `var i, j int = 1, 2` declares two variables `i` and `j` of type `int` and assigns them the values `1` and `2` respectively. Here, the `var` keyword is used to declare variables, and the type is explicitly specified.

```golang
func main() {
    var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
    fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the code inside the `main` function will be executed.
- Inside the `main` function, three variables `c`, `python`, and `java` are declared and assigned values. Since their types are not explicitly specified, Go will use type inference to determine their types based on the provided values (`true`, `false`, and `"no!"`).
- The `fmt.Println` function is used to print the values of variables to the console. Here, it prints the values of `i`, `j`, `c`, `python`, and `java` with spaces in between.

So, when you run the program, it will output:
```
1 2 true false no!
```

This output indicates that the values of `i` and `j` are `1` and `2` respectively, the value of `c` is `true`, the value of `python` is `false`, and the value of `java` is `"no!"`.


## Short variable declarations - 10/17

Inside a function, the `:=` short assignment statement can be used in place of a `var` declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (`var`, `func`, and so on) and so the `:=` construct is not available.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 10/17

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables i and j of type int with values 1 and 2 respectively.
    var i, j int = 1, 2
    
    // Declare and initialize variable k using short variable declaration with value 3.
    k := 3
    
    // Declare and initialize variables c, python, and java of type bool, bool, and string respectively.
    c, python, java := true, false, "no!"
    
    // Print the values of variables i, j, k, c, python, and java.
    fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. `package main`: This is the package declaration. In Go, the `main` package is special—it indicates that this is the executable entry point of the program.

2. `import "fmt"`: This imports the "fmt" package, which provides formatted I/O functions like `Println` that are used to print output to the console.

3. `func main() { ... }`: This is the main function, which serves as the entry point of the program. The program execution starts from here.

4. `var i, j int = 1, 2`: This declares two variables `i` and `j` of type `int` and initializes them with values 1 and 2 respectively. The `var` keyword is used for explicit variable declaration and type specification.

5. `k := 3`: This uses the short variable declaration (`:=`) to declare a variable `k` and initialize it with the value 3. Go automatically infers the variable's type based on the assigned value.

6. `c, python, java := true, false, "no!"`: This uses the short variable declaration to declare three variables `c`, `python`, and `java`. `c` and `python` are assigned boolean values `true` and `false` respectively. `java` is assigned the string value `"no!"`.

7. `fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)`: This line prints the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `c`, `python`, and `java` using the `Println` function from the "fmt" package. The values are printed in the order they appear, separated by spaces.

When you run this program, it will output:
```
1 2 3 true false no!
```

The output shows the values of the variables separated by spaces as printed by the `fmt.Println` function.


## Basic types - 11/17

Go's basic types are

```golang
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.

The `int`, `uint`, and `uintptr` types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use `int` unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.


### A break down of the Go code step by step: 11/17

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

// Declare package-level variables
var (
	ToBe   bool       = false              // Declare a boolean variable named ToBe with initial value false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1           // Declare an unsigned 64-bit integer variable named MaxInt with maximum value (2^64 - 1)
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i) // Declare a complex128 variable named z with the value of the square root of -5 + 12i
)

func main() {
	// Print the type and value of the variables using formatted printing
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)     // Print the type and value of ToBe
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt) // Print the type and value of MaxInt
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)           // Print the type and value of z
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `package main` statement indicates that this is the main package that contains the `main` function. It's the entry point for the executable.

2. The `import` block includes two imported packages: `fmt` for formatted I/O and `math/cmplx` for complex number operations.

3. The `var` block declares package-level variables with their initial values:
   - `ToBe` is a boolean variable initialized with the value `false`.
   - `MaxInt` is an unsigned 64-bit integer variable initialized with the maximum value representable by a 64-bit integer (2^64 - 1).
   - `z` is a complex128 variable initialized with the square root of the complex number `-5 + 12i`.

4. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

5. Inside the `main` function, three `fmt.Printf` statements are used to print the types and values of the declared variables:
   - `%T` is a formatting verb that prints the type of the variable.
   - `%v` is a formatting verb that prints the value of the variable.

6. The output of the program will be:
   ```
   Type: bool Value: false
   Type: uint64 Value: 18446744073709551615
   Type: complex128 Value: (2+3i)
   ```
   - The first line prints the type and value of the boolean variable `ToBe`.
   - The second line prints the type and value of the unsigned 64-bit integer variable `MaxInt`.
   - The third line prints the type and value of the complex128 variable `z`.

Overall, this program demonstrates variable declaration and initialization, formatted printing, and the use of complex numbers in Go.


## Zero values - 12/17

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

The zero value is:

    `0` for numeric types,
    `false` for the boolean type, and
    `""` (the empty string) for strings.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 12/17

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i int       // Declare an integer variable named 'i'
    var f float64   // Declare a float variable named 'f'
    var b bool      // Declare a boolean variable named 'b'
    var s string    // Declare a string variable named 's'

    fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
    // Print the values of 'i', 'f', 'b', and 's' using fmt.Printf
}
```

**Explanantion:**

1. `package main`: This line indicates that this is the main package, which is necessary for executable Go programs.

2. `import "fmt"`: This line imports the "fmt" package, which provides functions for formatted input and output. The `fmt.Printf` function will be used to print formatted output.

3. `func main() { ... }`: This is the main function, which is the entry point of the Go program.

4. `var i int`: This line declares an integer variable named `i` without assigning any value to it. In Go, variables are required to be used after declaration.

5. `var f float64`: This line declares a floating-point variable named `f` without assigning any value.

6. `var b bool`: This line declares a boolean variable named `b` without assigning any value.

7. `var s string`: This line declares a string variable named `s` without assigning any value.

8. `fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)`: This line uses the `fmt.Printf` function to format and print the values of `i`, `f`, `b`, and `s`.

   - `%v` is a placeholder for the value of a variable. It works for various types.
   - `%q` is a placeholder specifically for strings, and it formats the string as a quoted string.

   The variables are provided as arguments to the `fmt.Printf` function in the order of appearance. Since the variables `i`, `f`, and `b` have not been assigned values, they will have their respective zero values (`0`, `0.0`, and `false`), and the string `s` will be an empty string.

So, when the program is executed, it will output something like:
```
0 0 false ""
```

The values of `i`, `f`, `b`, and `s` are printed, and since `s` is an empty string, it is represented as an empty pair of double quotes.


## Type conversions - 13/17

The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`.

Some numeric conversions:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)
```
Or, put more simply:

```go
i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)
```

Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion. Try removing the `float64` or `uint` conversions in the example and see what happens.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 13/17

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	// Declare two integer variables x and y, both initialized with values 3 and 4 respectively.
	var x, y int = 3, 4

	// Calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of x and y.
	// Since the math.Sqrt function expects a float64, we convert x*x+y*y to float64 using float64().
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))

	// Convert the float64 value f to an unsigned integer (uint).
	var z uint = uint(f)

	// Print the values of x, y, and z.
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Package Declaration**: The code begins with the declaration of the `main` package. In Go, the `main` package is special and represents an executable program. All Go programs must have a `main` package, and the execution starts from the `main` function within it.

2. **Import Statements**: The `import` block is used to bring in external packages. In this code, two packages are imported: `fmt` (for formatted I/O) and `math` (for mathematical functions like square root).

3. **main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It's where the execution starts.

4. **Variable Declarations and Initialization**:
   - `var x, y int = 3, 4`: Two integer variables, `x` and `y`, are declared and initialized with the values 3 and 4 respectively. They represent the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle.
   
5. **Square Root Calculation**:
   - `var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))`: The `math.Sqrt` function computes the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The result is a `float64` value, so the expression `x*x + y*y` is first converted to a `float64` using `float64()`.

6. **Type Conversion**:
   - `var z uint = uint(f)`: The calculated square root `f` is then converted to an unsigned integer (`uint`). Since you can't directly assign a float to an integer type in Go, an explicit type conversion is required.

7. **Printing Values**:
   - `fmt.Println(x, y, z)`: The `fmt.Println` function is used to print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to the console. It formats the output as space-separated values.

In summary, this code calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem and then converts that length into an unsigned integer before printing the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to the console.



## Type inference - 14/17

When declaring a variable without specifying an explicit type (either by using the := syntax or var = expression syntax), the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.

When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type:

```go
var i int
j := i // j is an int
```
But when the right hand side contains an untyped numeric constant, the new variable may be an int, float64, or complex128 depending on the precision of the constant:

```go
i := 42           // int
f := 3.142        // float64
g := 0.867 + 0.5i // complex128
```

Try changing the initial value of v in the example code and observe how its type is affected.

```go
ackage main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	v := 42 // change me!
	fmt.Printf("v is of type %T\n", v)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 14/17

The Go code is a simple program that demonstrates the use of the `fmt.Printf` function to display the type of a variable. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `package main`: This line indicates that the code is part of the `main` package. In Go, every executable program must have a `main` package, and the `main` function within this package serves as the entry point of the program.

2. `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `"fmt"` package, which provides functions for formatted input and output. It will be used to print the type of the variable.

3. `func main() { ... }`: This is the main function of the program. It's where the execution of the program starts.

4. `v := 42`: This line declares a variable `v` and assigns the value `42` to it. The variable's type is inferred from the value it's assigned. In this case, `v` will be of type `int`.

5. `fmt.Printf("v is of type %T\n", v)`: This line uses the `Printf` function from the `"fmt"` package to print a formatted string. The format specifier `%T` is used to print the type of the variable `v`. The value of `v` will replace `%T` in the output. The `\n` at the end of the string is an escape sequence representing a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing.

So, when you run this program, it will output:
```
v is of type int
```

The program declares a variable `v` with the value `42`, and then it uses `Printf` to print the type of `v`, which is `int`, as indicated in the output. If you were to change the value of `v` to a different type (e.g., a string, float, etc.), the output would reflect that new type.



## Constants - 15/17

Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword.

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

Constants cannot be declared using the `:=` syntax.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
	const World = "世界"
	fmt.Println("Hello", World)
	fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

	const Truth = true
	fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 15/17

Of course! I'd be happy to provide a detailed breakdown of the given Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14
```

- `package main`: This declares that this Go code is part of the `main` package. The `main` package is a special package used to create executable programs in Go.

- `import "fmt"`: This imports the "fmt" package, which provides functions for formatted I/O (input/output) operations. In this code, it's used for printing to the console.

- `const Pi = 3.14`: This defines a constant named `Pi` with a value of `3.14`. Constants are immutable and can't be changed after they are declared. Here, `Pi` represents an approximation of the mathematical constant π (pi).

```go
func main() {
	const World = "世界"
	fmt.Println("Hello", World)
	fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

	const Truth = true
	fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

- `func main() { ... }`: This is the main function of the program, which is the entry point for execution. All Go programs start executing from the `main` function.

- `const World = "世界"`: This declares a constant named `World` with a value of "世界", which means "world" in Chinese. The constant is scoped to the `main` function.

- `fmt.Println("Hello", World)`: This line uses the `fmt` package's `Println` function to print the string "Hello" followed by the value of the `World` constant. This will display "Hello 世界" in the console.

- `fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")`: Similarly, this line prints "Happy", the value of the `Pi` constant, and "Day" with spaces in between. The output will be "Happy 3.14 Day".

- `const Truth = true`: This declares a constant named `Truth` with a value of `true`.

- `fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)`: This line prints "Go rules?" followed by the value of the `Truth` constant. The output will be "Go rules? true".

In summary, this Go code defines a few constants (`Pi`, `World`, and `Truth`) and demonstrates how to use the `fmt` package to print messages to the console along with the values of these constants.



## Numeric Constants - 16/17

Numeric constants are high-precision values.

An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.

Try printing `needInt(Big)` too.

(An `int` can store at maximum a 64-bit integer, and sometimes less.)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	// Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
	// In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
	Big = 1 << 100
	// Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
	Small = Big >> 99
)

func needInt(x int) int { return x*10 + 1 }
func needFloat(x float64) float64 {
	return x * 0.1
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(needInt(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Big))
}
```

### A break down of the Go code step by step: 16/17

	const Truth = true
	fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

- `const Truth = true`: This declares a constant named `Truth` with a value of `true`.

- `fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)`: This line prints "Go rules?" followed by the value of the `Truth` constant. The output will be "Go rules? true".

In summary, this Go code defines a few constants (`Pi`, `World`, and `Truth`) and demonstrates how to use the `fmt` package to print messages to the console along with the values of these constants.
