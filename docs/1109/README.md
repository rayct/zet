# My Go Stuff - 2023

The folder structure for a project in go.work (a hypothetical framework or application) can vary based on the specific requirements, size of the project, and the chosen architectural patterns. However, I can provide you with a basic and common folder structure for a Go (Golang) project:

1. **cmd**: This folder typically contains the main applications or services that will be executed. Each subdirectory within `cmd` is named after a specific application or service and contains a `main.go` file.

    ```
    project/
    └── cmd/
        ├── app1/
        │   └── main.go
        ├── app2/
        │   └── main.go
        └── ...
    ```

2. **pkg**: This folder holds the packages that are intended to be used by other applications or services within the project. It may include reusable libraries, utilities, and functionalities.

    ```
    project/
    └── pkg/
        ├── package1/
        │   └── *.go
        ├── package2/
        │   └── *.go
        └── ...
    ```

3. **internal**: This folder includes packages that are specific to the project and should not be imported by other projects. It is typically used to enforce encapsulation and limit package access.

    ```
    project/
    └── internal/
        ├── package1/
        │   └── *.go
        ├── package2/
        │   └── *.go
        └── ...
    ```

4. **api**: This folder contains API-related code, including route handlers, request/response models, and middleware.

    ```
    project/
    └── api/
        ├── handlers/
        │   └── *.go
        ├── models/
        │   └── *.go
        ├── middleware/
        │   └── *.go
        └── ...
    ```

5. **config**: This folder includes configuration files or code to handle configurations for the project.

    ```
    project/
    └── config/
        └── config.yaml
    ```

6. **scripts**: This folder may contain various scripts for building, testing, or deploying the project.

    ```
    project/
    └── scripts/
        ├── build.sh
        ├── test.sh
        └── deploy.sh
    ```

7. **docs**: This folder may hold project documentation, such as API documentation, architecture diagrams, and usage guides.

    ```
    project/
    └── docs/
        ├── api_documentation.md
        ├── architecture_diagram.png
        └── usage_guide.md
    ```

8. **static** or **assets**: This folder can contain static files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other assets.

    ```
    project/
    └── static/
        ├── index.html
        ├── styles.css
        └── ...
    ```

9. **tests**: This folder holds test-related files, including unit tests, integration tests, and test fixtures.

    ```
    project/
    └── tests/
        ├── unit_tests/
        │   └── *.go
        ├── integration_tests/
        │   └── *.go
        └── ...
    ```

*This structure is a starting point and can be modified based on your specific project's needs, size, and complexity. It's important to organize your code in a way that makes sense for your project and team.*
