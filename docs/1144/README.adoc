= Chess Notes - 2024

1. **Pawn**:
   - Pawns move forward one square, but they capture diagonally.
   - On their first move, pawns have the option to advance two squares forward.
   - Pawns promote to any other piece (except another pawn) if they reach the opposite end of the board.

2. **Rook**:
   - Rooks move horizontally or vertically across the board any number of unobstructed squares.

3. **Knight**:
   - Knights move in an L-shape, either two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular to that.
   - Knights are the only piece that can "jump" over other pieces.

4. **Bishop**:
   - Bishops move diagonally across the board any number of unobstructed squares.

5. **Queen**:
   - Queens combine the movement of rooks and bishops. They can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of unobstructed squares.

6. **King**:
   - Kings can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

_Remember, each player has a set of these pieces, and the objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning to put it in a position where it cannot escape capture._
