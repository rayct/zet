# Algebra and Calculus Roadmap - 2023/24

**The order in which I will learn algebra, pre-calculus, and calculus typically follows a structured progression in mathematics:**

1. **Algebra:** Algebra is the fundamental building block for more advanced math. Start with basic algebra, including solving equations, working with variables, and understanding concepts like linear equations, inequalities, and systems of equations.

2. **Pre-Calculus:** Pre-calculus is the next step after mastering algebra. In pre-calculus, you'll delve into more advanced algebraic concepts and functions, including polynomials, exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometry, and conic sections. It also includes topics like sequences, series, and limits, which serve as a bridge to calculus.

3. **Calculus:** Calculus is typically divided into two parts: differential calculus (Calculus 1) and integral calculus (Calculus 2). The order of learning these can vary, but most students start with differential calculus. In Calculus 1, you'll study the concepts of limits, derivatives, and their applications, such as finding slopes, rates of change, and optimization problems. In Calculus 2, you'll delve into integrals and their applications, including finding areas under curves and solving more complex problems.

*The progression from algebra to pre-calculus to calculus ensures that you build a strong foundation in algebraic and trigonometric concepts before diving into the more complex ideas in calculus.*
